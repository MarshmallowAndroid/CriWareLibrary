# CriWareLibrary

Simple library I wrote for working with or reading CRIWARE formats (specifically the ACB/AWB formats) in C#.
Not very fast or efficient but they get the job done for my use case.

Most, if not all, of the code are just ported over to C# from [vgmstream](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream).

For an HCA decoder I also ported to C#, refer to [ClHcaSharp](https://github.com/MarshmallowAndroid/ClHcaSharp).
