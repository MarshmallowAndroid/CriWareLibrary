# CriWareTools

Tools I wrote for working/reading with CRIWARE formats (mostly ACB/AWB and HCA) in .NET.

I don't think they're very fast or efficient but they get the job done for my use case.

Nothing special, honestly. Most, if not all, of the code are just ported over from [vgmstream](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream).
